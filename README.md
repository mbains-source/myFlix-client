myFlix client-side app Achievement 3


Objective
---------
The objective of this achievement is building the client side application for the Application Programming Interface 
completed in Achievement 2, hence the repository name myFlix Client. 

Description
------------

After building the database for the MyFlix application as part of Achievement Two, it was time to construct the client side application
or FrontEnd. As part of this achievement three, I learned how to use React, an industry standard library, for constructing the client side application
itself. I was able to learn about concepts like JSX/SCSS and React Bootstrap in order to build the Client-Side Application which I was able to successfully
host on Netlify. The website can be visited at the following link https://myflixclientmantajbains.netlify.app/login.
